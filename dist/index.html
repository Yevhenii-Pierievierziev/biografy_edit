						<h2 class="block__title">Who Is Tom Hardy?</h2>
						<p class="block__description">Actor Tom Hardy first stepped into the spotlight after his role in the
							miniseries Band Of Brothers (2001). Other major roles followed, including in the films Black Hawk
							Down (2001), Star Trek: Nemesis (2002), Inception (2010), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Lawless
							(2012) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2014). Hardy received his first Oscar nomination for his role as
							John Fitzgerald in the drama The Revenant (2015), and went on to star in the Spider-Man spinoff
							Venom (2018).</p>

					<div class="article__block block">
						<h2 class="block__title">Early Life</h2>
						<p class="block__description">Edward Thomas Hardy was born on September 15, 1977, in Hammersmith, London, England. The only child of comedy and novel writer Edward Hardy and artist mother Anne, Hardy suffered from alcoholism, drug addiction and delinquency during his teen and early adult years.

							Despite his demons, Hardy went on to pursue acting at the Richmond Drama School and the prestigious Drama Centre London. His intense commitment fine-tuned Hardy's acting skills. In a December 2002 interview with IGN, the actor stated, "When other schools would be doing, sort of, 30 hours, we were doing 60. And we'd be doing stuff that would prepare you in a very different way."</p>

					<div class="article__block block">
						<h2 class="block__title">'The Revenant'</h2>
						<p class="block__description">Also in 2015, Hardy co-starred with Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant, a harrowing 19th-century drama focusing on two men who become bitter enemies in the wilderness. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, the project earned 12 Academy Award nominations, with Hardy receiving his first Oscar nomination in the category of supporting actor.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="article__block block">
						<h2 class="block__title">'Taboo,' 'Venom'</h2>
						<p class="block__description">Hardy returned to the small screen in 2017 in the British series Taboo, which he co-created with his father and Steven Knight. The following year, he starred as the titular anti-hero of the Spider-Man spinoff Venom, a film that drew a middling response from critics but performed well enough at the box office to send a sequel into production.</p>
